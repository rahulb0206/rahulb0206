## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Rahul Balasubramani!
I'm an enthusiastic master's student with a keen interest in leveraging data and technology to solve complex problems. My journey in tech has been fueled by a passion for Machine Learning, Data Science, and creating impactful solutions.

# ðŸš€ My Journey So Far

- Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Management at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a focus on data science and information systems.
- Previously worked as a Junior ML Engineer at Augray, where I optimized machine learning models for real-time applications, improved large-scale data preprocessing, and enhanced system scalability and response efficiency in Conversational AI projects.

# ðŸ›  Technical Arsenal

Iâ€™ve honed my skills across various technologies:
- Programming: C, C++, Python (Frameworks: NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Pillow, Matplotlib, Seaborn), NLP, Machine learning, and algorithms.
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker, MS Office.
- Cloud Services: Amazon Web Services (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner), Microsoft Azure.
- Database Technologies: SQL (MySQL), MongoDB.
- Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI.

# ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience

Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through diverse roles:
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Conducted extensive data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering on datasets up to 10TB, improving data quality by 20% and enhancing model performance.
- Machine Learning Model Optimization: Implemented and optimized MIDAS U-Net and MobileNet-v2 models, leading to significant improvements in application performance and 3D visualization using the Open 3D framework.
- Real-Time Fault Detection: Developed real-time fault detection systems for a sports ball manufacturing firm using MobileNet-v2, achieving 90% accuracy and reducing detection time by 50% with intuitive GUI interfaces on Nvidia Jetson Boards.
- Conversational AI: Collaborated with the Conversational AI team on RASA-based solutions, enhancing response efficiency by 25% and improving scalability by 40%.
